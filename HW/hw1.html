		<p>
			<sup>1</sup>If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have "love", I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
			<sup>2</sup>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have "love", I am nothing.
			<sup>3</sup>If I give all possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have "love", I gain nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>4</sup>"Love" is patient, "love" is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
			<sup>5</sup>It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
			<sup>6</sup>"Love" does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
			<sup>7</sup>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perserveres.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>8</sup>"Love" never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; 
			where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
			<sup>9</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
			<sup>10</sup>but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
			<sup>11</sup>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, 
			I reasoned like a child. When I became a ma, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
			<sup>12</sup>For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. 
			Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>13</sup>And now these three remain: faith, hope and "love". But the greates of these is "love".
