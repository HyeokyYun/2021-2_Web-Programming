	<h1>1 Corinthian Chapter 13 (<abbr title="New International Version">NIV</abbr>)</h1>
	<h2>Book of Love</h2>
	<p><sup>1</sup>If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have <q>love</q>, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 
	<sup>2</sup>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have <q>love</q>, I am nothing.
	<sup>3</sup>If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have <q>love</q>, I gain nothing.</p>
	<p><sup>4</sup><q>Love</q> is patient, <q>love</q> is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
	<sup>5</sup>It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
	<sup>6</sup><q>Love</q> does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
	<sup>7</sup>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>
	<p><sup>8</sup><q>Love</q> never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
	<sup>9</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
	<sup>10</sup>but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.
	<sup>11</sup>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.
	<sup>12</sup>For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>
	<p><sup>13</sup>And now these three remain: faith, hope and <q>love</q>. But the greatest of these is <q>love</q>.</p>
